# Laptop Price Prediction using Multilinear Regression

## Project Overview 
This project builds a Multilinear Regression model to predict laptop prices based on key specifications such as **RAM, CPU speed, GPU brand, and laptop type**. The dataset is preprocessed to handle categorical variables, missing values, and numerical conversions. The model helps understand which factors influence laptop pricing and how well it can generalize across different brands and configurations.  

## Key Features 
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, extracts CPU & GPU details, and applies one-hot encoding for categorical features.  
- Model Training: Implements Multilinear Regression to learn relationships between laptop specifications and price.  
- Performance Evaluation: Assesses model accuracy using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² score.  
- Visualization: Compares actual vs. predicted prices using matplotlib scatter plots.  

## Limitations & Future Enhancements  
- The model assumes a linear relationship, which may not fully capture complex pricing trends.  
- Brand value & new technologies (e.g., latest CPU & GPU models) may not be well-represented.  
- Future improvements could include non-linear models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or deep learning for better predictions.
